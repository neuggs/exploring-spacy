# exploring spaCy

This project follows Prateek Joshi's [Medium.com](https://medium.com) article [Introduction to Information Extraction using Python and spaCy](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/introduction-to-information-extraction-using-python-and-spacy-858f5d6416ca).

# Requirements

The project was created using Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda. There are several packages imported including:

* re 
* string 
* nltk 
* pandas
* numpy
* math 
* tqdm 
* spacy

spaCy is certainly most important. I also suggest the [spaCy online DataCamp style class](https://course.spacy.io/). It's worth noting that this class is also offered in DataCamp.

You can use `pip install` (or whatever your preferred package manager is) to install the packages.
